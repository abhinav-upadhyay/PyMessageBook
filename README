A 'hello world' kind of a Python projec which I created to explain the basic
constructs of Python like classes, modules, functions, dictionary, lists etc.
for an internal tutorial session at my workplace (delivered by me).

PyMessageBook is a simple message book kind of an app. It can store
contact list of a user and the messages from those contacts. It persists
information on the disk using JSON.
